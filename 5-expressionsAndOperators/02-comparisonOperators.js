// Comparison Operators
// used to compare one value to another

// Equal to another value
'3' == 3;
// = means to assign, == means to compare

'3' === 3;
// Strictly equal is === would check the data types match and values (best practice to use ===)

3 === 3; //this is strictly equal

// Not equal
3 != 4; //output true;

// Strictly Not Equal
'3' !== 3; 

// Greater than
3 > 2;

// Less than
2 < 3;

// Greater than or Equal to
3 >= 2; //write it as you would say it

// Less than or equal to
2 <= 3;

// And
2 && 3;

// Or
2 || 3; // pipe symbol, which is the key on top of the enter key
