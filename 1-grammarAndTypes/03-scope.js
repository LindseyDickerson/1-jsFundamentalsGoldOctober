// Scope is where variables are and aren't accessible in our code. Think baby jail.

//Global scope: The world
//Local scope: Indianapolis

//Scope determines the accessibility / visibility of certain variables

//function scope and block scope
// var does not respect scope, but let stays within the scope it is in
